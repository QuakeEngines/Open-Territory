# Open Territory clone
This is copy of Open Territory project. It's not in active development (since 2010), and I am not its author. I simply cloned it to Github for convenience. Original readme file, containing full description and installation instructions is "**[readme.txt](https://github.com/Maxxiii/Open-Territory/blob/master/README.txt)**".  
P.S. Currently developing successor of Open Territory / XreaL - [Daemon Engine](https://github.com/DaemonEngine/Daemon)  

## Description
**XreaL** is a heavily improved Quake 3 Arena engine. It's bundled with new tools and a demo game that was never finished.  
**ET:XreaL** is a subproject bringing all XreaL enhancements to Return to Castle Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory.  
**Open Territory** is fork of ET:XreaL
